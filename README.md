# Book-Search

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to learn and practice how to implement graphql resolvers and querys to a MERN project to get the specific information that the user has to in this case achieving saving and delating books from the users profile, also the implementation of authentication factor with apollo server for the login and the signup form

The reason to build this project was again to improve my graphql skills.

The main lesson of this project was how to achieve the resolvers and the typeDefs schema matching.
